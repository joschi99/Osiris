		If you do use NeDi's network monitoring features, this is the module to just leave open in a browser.
		It'll refresh every minute to alert you (with original www.PSI.ch siren sounds!), if something went bad.
		The size of the graphs can be set in User-Profile.
		If you drill down into locations, the messages and events will be filtered accordingly. A mobile version without graphs and session management (no login required) can be accessed with mh.php.
		Simply delete this file, if you don't want to allow this.

		Top section:
		<ul>
			<li>Displays overall network condition
			<li>Target availability, excessive traffic or errors on interfaces
			<li>Exceeded CPU, memory and temperature thresholds of devices
		</ul>

		Event section:
		<ul>
			<li>Some statistic to the left and important events within the last 24h to the right are shown by default
			<li>Adjust #top events in User-Profile (< 6 shows less statistics, < 3 no events at all)
		</ul>
		
		Topology section:
		<ul>
			<li>Works just like Topology-Map, providing operational status of locations in addition
			<li>Monitored nodes and non-SNMP devices won't be shown
			<li>A shaded backgroun indicates that not all devices are monitored in a location
			<li>Events with a level of 250 cause a flashing warning symbol to appear on the respective location (in general, an event can be acknowledged by clicking its Id)
			<li>Adjust #columns in User-Profile fit your screen (setting it to 0 hides this section)
		</ul>
