		<h2 class="lft txtb">Topology Table</h2>

		If your devices are configured with SNMP location information according to <a href="http://www.nedi.ch/documentation/"> NeDi's scheme</a>, you can drill down into your network in a tabular fashion here.
		<p>
		Those buttons on the top right help navigating and reveal more information:
		<ul>
			<li>Click <img src="../../img/16/bbup.png"> to get to the top, <img src="../../img/16/glob.png"> to region, <img src="../../img/16/fort.png"> to city, or <img src="../../img/16/home.png"> to building level.
			<li><img src="../../img/16/dev.png"> displays number of devices per location
			<li><img src="../../img/16/nods.png"> adds node population per location
			<li><img src="../../img/p45.png"> adds free access ports per location
			<li>Clicking on location names lists all its devices (the displayed width is set in User-Profile <img src="../../img/16/form.png"> ).
			<li>You can "paint" important buildings red(ish) with redbuild in nedi.conf.
			<li>A street address can have several buildings, if bldsep is configured correctly. A digit showing the amount of sub-buildings is added, if there are more than one.
		</ul>

		The next button cycles the display of your sites. The state is preserved within the session and is used in Monitoring-Health as well:
		<ul>
			<li><img src="../../img/16/det.png"> Switches to small icons (good for displaying hundreds of sites)
			<li><img src="../../img/16/paint.png"> Shows NeDi maps (for a glance inside)
			<li><img src="../../img/16/map.png"> Shows Openstreet maps (which are cached in topo/) or (uncached) Googlemaps, if enabled in User-Profile.
			<li><img src="../../img/16/wthr.png"> Adds wheather information for cities, with that you know when it's down because of a thunderstorm.
			<li><img src="../../img/16/icon.png"> Reverts to the default icon display.
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Building Level</h3>

		Inside a building you get to see the devices on each floor and room. If you specified the rack and rack-unit, the room name becomes a link which takes you to the rackview.
		<ul>
			<li>Clicking on a floor lists all matching devices.
			<li><img src="../../img/16/wlan.png"> Toggles displaying non-SNMP devices.
			<li><img src="../../img/16/foto.png"> Shows device panels instead of icons.
			<li>If photos or documents named Building-Floor-something (ignoring non-word characters) are found in topo/Region/City they're presented with an icon underneath the floor label. Clicking on them reveals the photo in a popup window or opens the file.
		</ul>
