		<h2 class="lft txtb">System Snapshot</h2>

		This modules lets you take a snapshot of the current database. This may be very helpful for a network migration for example, as you can go back in time and examine your network prior any changes
		<p>
		In addition you can import a NeDi database from a completely different network for review, without affecting your "real" data.

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Adding a Snapshot</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Enter a suffix to identify your snapshot. By default a timestamp is filled in.
			<li>Provide DB admin user (usually root) and password.
			<li>Click the "Add" button to copy the current database to the snapshot (might take a while).
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Activating a Snapshot</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>The database used in the current session is indicated by <img src="../../img/16/walk.png">.
			<li>Click on <img src="../../img/16/bcls.png"> in the snapshot list to activate either the main database or a snapshot.
			<li>The <img src="../../img/ns.png"> logo on the top left is replaced by <img src="../../img/16/foto.png" class="warn"> to remind you, that you're working in a snapshot now. Hover over it to reveal which one.
			<li>Alarm sounds and rrdgraphs are turned off as well to avoid any confusion until you select the main database again (usually 'nedi').
			<li>You can manipulate data in a snapshot, but it won't have an effect on the current database, since the discovery keeps using the main database.
			<li>This applies for importing a DB with System-Files as well, meaning you can actually import a completely different database
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Deleting a Snapshot</h3>

		<ul>
			<li> Click on <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png"> to delete a snapshot (only shown on inactive snapshots).
			<li> After confirmation the snapshot will be deleted and its diskspace freed up.
		</ul>
