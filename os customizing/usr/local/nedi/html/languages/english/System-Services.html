		<h2 class="lft txtb">NeDi Services</h2>

		View processes and resources of your NeDi host and start or stop certain services. 
		<ul>
			<li>The top section shows and controls NeDi related services.
			<li>The lower section shows all running processes and some system stats.
			<li>Click on <img src="../../img/16/walk.png"> to stop or <img src="../../img/16/bcls.png"> start a service
			<li>This only works, if the services don't need to open any priviledged ports (< 1024). Of course you could run the webserver as root, but that can create security risks! Therefore NeDi's Syslog (syslog.pl) and snmptrapd run on high-ports and usually are redirected by an internal firewall.
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Discovery</h3>

		Depending on the size and topology of your network, it makes sense to run several discovery threads at the same time.
		<ul>
			<li>Do this by dividing the network in a few sections using borders and different seedfiles and add crontab entries accordingly
			<li>On the far right you see the discovery status (# of threads is revealed by hovering over <img src="../../img/16/walk.png">
			<li>In case a discovery terminated unexpectedly, you can reset it by clicking on <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png">. 
		</ul>
