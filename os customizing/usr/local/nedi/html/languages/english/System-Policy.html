			Make sure you understand how policy actions work! You can disable all network interfaces for example, if you don't know what you're doing!
		</div>
		<p>

		This module lets you define conditions on device configurations, neighbors or learned MAC addresses and take action on match or miss.
		<p>
		The following uses cases can be covered:

		<p>
		<strong>Stolen Nodes</strong>
		<p>

		<ol>
			<li>Click on <img src="../../img/16/hat3.png"> in Nodes-Status to create a MAC policy of that node
			<li>Adjust Alert setting or info text and click add
			<li>Everytime this MAC address is found, you'll be notified according to the alert setting
		</ol>

		<p>
		<strong>Configuration Compliance</strong>
		<p>

		<ol>
			<li>Select "Configuration" from the class selectbox and enter regexp to match (e.g. 'snmp-server community public')
			<li>Adjust Alert setting and information text and click add
			<li>Everytime this text occurs in a configuration, you'll be notified according to the alert setting
			<li>Narrow down the matches by specifying a regexp for device type, location or group for example
			<li>Alternatively you can change the operator to '!~' to get alerts on missing configuration statements
		</ol>

		<p>
		<strong>PoE Police</strong>
		<p>

		<ol>
			<li>Add a Neighbor Policy with the "Skip Action" to allow Poe delivery to phones or controlled APs.
			<li>Add a MAC Policy to either match (~) on particular addresses or enter a '.' to match any
			<li>Narrow down the matches by specifying a regexp for device type, location or group for example
			<li>Optionally select an interface condition to only trigger if PoE was active in the previous discovery
			<li>Select 'PoE Disabled' Action and add a reset policy by selecting a timeframe after which PoE should be re-enabled (status will be new and it's timestamp set in the future)
			<li>Upon the first discovery, when its timestamp is in the past, the reset policy is executed to restore PoE delivery
			<li>Adjust Alert setting and information text and click add
		</ol>

		<p>
		<strong>General Topics</strong>
		<p>

		<ul>
			<li>A policy cannot be edited, but copied by clicking on <img src="../../img/16/copy.png"> and then added again
			<li>A policy can be disabled by clicking on <img src="../../img/16/bdis.png"> (and enabled respectively)
			<li>A policy can be removed by clicking on <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png">
			<li>The "Skip Action" withelists a port, thus avoids any action to be performed
			<li>Thoroughly test policies without actions before 'arming' them with one
			<li>Always add a reset action to recover disabled ports automatically
			<li>Actions are supported on IOS and ProCurve devices at the moment (config is not saved to flash)
			<li>In case an error occured while getting device neighbors, the skip action is applied to concerned interfaces (inhibiing erratic actions)
			<li>The information text is used in events, emails and sms, but also serves as comment in the policy list (e.g. if no Alert is selected)
			<li>Actions are written to 
			<li>By default a policy summary report is shown to pol_ files in the cli folder. Those files an the logs can be reviewed in System-Files
		</ul>
