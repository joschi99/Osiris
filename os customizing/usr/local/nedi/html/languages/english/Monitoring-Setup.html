		<h2 class="lft txtb">Monitoring Setup</h2>

		Configure how targets are monitored and how users are notified upon their failure. 
		The concept of Monitoring-Setup is to use the filter in order to apply settings to a single or multiple (e.g. hundreds of) targets at once.
		
		<ul>
			<li>Thresholds can be individually set per target
			<li>In addition you can specify if traps, syslog or discovery events should be discarded, forwarded or elevated to maximum level
			<li>Use the templates (icons above filter) or click on the links of Target (to match a single target)
			<li>Clicking on a test icon executes a monitoring test on this target
			<li>Clicking on Alert or Events Action from the list applies it as filter
		</ul>
		
		<h3 class="lft txtb">Monitor</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Set the Test <img src="../../img/16/say.png"> or set to "No" to avoid active polling and just control Events or Discover thresholds
			<li>Select icmp if TCP ping doesn't work on a target. Enter # of packets in <img src="../../img/16/bbrt.png">, if you want to send more than 1
			<li>Test http/https: You can enter a string like "index.html" in <img src="../../img/16/bbrt.png"> and a regexp matching a successful response in <img src="../../img/16/bblf.png">. Only a SYN check (TCP ping on port 80) is performed, if you don't
			<li>Test dns: you can send a hostname and a regexp matching the expected IP address
			<li>Test ntp: you can send RFC2030 fields like "Stratum" and enter a match ^[1-5]$ to detect if your ntp server lost sync
			<li>Clicking "Update" applies the settings to the displayed targets
			<li>Clicking "Delete" removes the displayed targets from monitoring
			<li>Select email or SMS alerts, just have incidents create Monitoring-Events or  nothing at all. If you select a repeat option, the alert is resent every 100th failed test and in addition you can adjust latency warnings for slower targets
			<li>Click on <img src="../../img/16/ford.png"> to simulate an outtage of the first monitored target
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Events/Threshold</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><img src="../../img/16/bell.png"> Select Forward and enter a regexp to match the message and/or select a minimum event level to get a mail on matching  events
			<li>Alternatively you can select Discard, a maximum event level and/or a regexp and matching events will not even be stored in the DB (A forward match of a target overrules a discard match. Level limit can only be used to forward OR discard but not both)
			<li>Setting a regexp for Maximum raises matching events to level 250 (Emergency) and shows those within the past 24h in Monitoring-Health (useful to identify failed power supplies or stack members)
			<li>The notify settings from nedi.conf can be overridden for each target in the <img src="../../img/16/radr.png"> field
			<li>Device specific thresholds can be set with the <img src="../../img/16/cpu.png">, <img src="../../img/16/mem.png"> etc. fields
		</ul>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Reset</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><img src="../../img/16/net.png"> Updates target IP address from devices or nodes (in case they've changed, there's a  <img src="../../img/16/bdis.png"> icon in the target status)
			<li><img src="../../img/16/ncon.png"> Sets dependency info, if available via links or device information (in case of node targets). After that, the dependencies can be adjusted on each target individually
			<li><img src="../../img/16/walk.png"> Reset the availability counters (lost & ok) once a year if you need to know annual availability for example
			<li>A yellow/shaded target status indicates that its not found as node or device anymore (and should probably be deleted)
		</ul>
