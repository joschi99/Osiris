		<h4>This is a very helpful, but also dangerous module! Always use with caution, because you could create a big mess rather quickly!</h4>

		This module lets you send CLI commands to devices and review the output instantly:
		<ul>
			<li>Use filter to select the desired devices.
			<li>Enter some commands in the "Execute / Configuration" area
			<li>Click "Show" to simulate the process
			<li>Click "Execute" to send the commands
			<li>Click "Configuration" to enter configuration mode before sending the commands and save the configuration afterwards.
			<li>On IOS or devices device with similar interface names you can use the "Interface Configuration" section to configure an interface range.
			<li>Only devices of the same operating system can be used at once.
			<li>Make sure you adjust GUI authentication (towards the end of nedi.conf) to fit your needs.
			<li>If you're unsure about this whole thing, delete inc/devwrite.pl to completely disable sending commands via webinterface!
		</ul>
