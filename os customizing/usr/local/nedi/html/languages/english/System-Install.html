		<p>

		This module is part of NeDi's provisioning system. It allows for installing unconfigured switches upon discovery. The procedure is divided into the following setps:
		<ol>
			<li>Create install entries specifying device type and IP address to be matched. The desired name and IP settings need to be set as well, rest is optional
			<li>Create an install template with System-Files (see below)
			<li>Perform installation (with nedi.pl -T or checking "Install" in System-NeDi). If type and IP match an install entry with the state "New", the target IP is pinged
			<li>If no answer comes back the entry is used to create a device configuration from the install template. The state of the install entry is changed to "Active"
			<li>If the device is discovered with the new IP address the state of the install entry is changed to "Used"
			<li>Check verbose nedi.pl output, if status changes to "Broken"
			<li>By default an install entries summary report is shown
		</ol>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Install Template</h3>

		An install template persists of a series of commands (1 command per line with optional confirmation and timeout separated by ;) to prepare the target device and a config template with placeholders, which are filled in from the install entry. If used, the password is taken from the appropriate user in nedi.conf, but usually is a fixed/encryped string
