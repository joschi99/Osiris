		<h2 class="lft txtb">Devices Graph</h2>

		This module allows you to dynamically generate stacked interface graphs and much more.
		<p>
		Please note that NeDi's graphing feature was implemented as an addition to the discovery with lowest possible resource and maintenance cost in mind. 
		<p>
		It will not graph those 5 minute peaks (unless you run NeDi every 5 minutes in very small networks), but provides a longterm view 
		of each and every interface. This translates to baselining and prediction of potential bottlenecks, instead of identifying erratic outbursts of any kind (You'd prefer using a tool like Cacti to monitor this instead).

		<ul>
			<li>Select any top graphs if you wish to get the big picture on your network.
			<li>Selecting a device will reveal its interfaces. You can choose several of them to be stacked dynamically (doesn't work for IF status!).
			<li>Select several graph sources at once to correlate and investigate problems (e.g. CPU load, broadcasts on some interfaces of a device)
			<li>System related graphs are CPU, Memory and Temperature and a custom graph for other values.
			<li>Use double arrows to move start (top one), the whole graph (middle) or its end (bottom one) by weeks or single arrows for days. Click on a date icon to manually set a start or end time.
			<li>If you can't live without degrees Fahrenheit, check it in User-Profile.
			<li>If you use Cacti on the same host, set $cacticli in html/inc/libmisc.php to easily add graphs...
			<li>CPU and memory corresponds to System load and battery capacity on UPS'.
