		<h2 class="lft txtb">Monitoring Master</h2>

		The master console is intended for use on a central NeDi host, where only the master.pl daemon is running.
		All other GUI modules except Devices-List, Devices-Status, Reports-Monitoring and Monitoring-Events should be disabled to avoid confusion.
		In addition a unique theme should be selected to further distinguish this host from regular NeDi installations.

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Setup</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Add remote NeDi installations to the agentlist and add the usernames and passwords to access them in nedi.conf
			<li>Run master.pl from System-Services (only visible if Monitoring-Master is enabled in nedi.conf)
			<li>Go to Devices-List and add detected agents to monitoring (NeDi agents are treated as devices)
			<li>Go to Monitoring-Setup and select http or https to tell master.pl how to access the agents
			<li>Go back to System-Services to restart master.pl or wait for a 'pause' intervall to get the agents polled
		</ol>

		<h3 class="lft txtb">Operation</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Upon first access, master.pl reads the last event with level 200 (alert) or above and all unacknowledged incidents.
			<li>On subsequent runs only new alert-events are read. Incidents are removed from the master console, if they're acknowledged on the agent.
			<li>Monitoring-Master shows those events and incidents with quick links to the respective agents.
		</ul>
