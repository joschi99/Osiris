How to configure OpenSSL on CentOS RedHat Linux

    Change your working directory to /etc/pki/CA
    cd /etc/pki/CA
    Create a folder to hold the Certificates
    mkdir certs
    Create a folder to hold the Certificate Revocation List
    mkdir crl
    Create a folder to hold the Server Certificates in PEM (unencrypted) format
    mkdir newcerts
    Create a file that holds the database of certificates
    touch index.txt
    Create a file that holds the next certificate serial number
    echo '01' > serial
    Create a file that holds the next Certificate Revocation List serial number
    echo '01' > crlnumber
    Make a copy the systems default openssl configuration file for our use
    cp /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf openssl.cnf
    Edit the /etc/pki/CA/openssl.cnf file making the following changes
        Change line 37
        from dir             = ../../CA              # Where everything is kept
        to dir             = .                     # Where everything is kept
        Change line 45
        from certificate     = $dir/cacert.pem       # The CA certificate
        to certificate     = $dir/certs/ca.crt     # The CA certificate
        Change line 50
        from private_key     = $dir/private/cakey.pem# The private key
        to private_key     = $dir/private/ca.key   # The private key
    Make the /etc/pki/CA/openssl.cnf file not world readable
    chmod 0600 openssl.cnf

    
Create a Certificate Authority (CA)

    cd /etc/pki/CA
    CA für 30 Jahre erstellen
    openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout private/ca.key -out certs/ca.crt -days 10950
    Enter PEM pass phrase: $password
    Re-Enter PEM pass phrase: $password
    Country Name: $country
    State or Province Name: $state
    Locality Name: $city
    Organization Name: $company
    Organizational Unit Name: $department = Certificate Authority
    Common Name: ca.$domain
    Email Address: ca@$domain
    Restrict access to the private key so that only root can read it
    chmod 0400 private/ca.key
